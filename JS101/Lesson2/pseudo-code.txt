a function that returns the sum of two numbers

Given two numbers. 
Add the two numbers together
Return the sum of the two numbers

START
# Given two numbers

GET num1 = first Number
GET num2 = second number
SET sum = sum of the two numbers

sum = num1 + num2

PRINT sum
END





a function that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Given an array of strings
combine each string with the next to form one long string
return the combined string

START

SET stringarray = the given array of strings
SET combinedstring = the combined strings
SET iterator = 1

WHILE  iterator <= length of the stringarray
    SET currentstring = value of string at space iterator
    SET combinedstring = combinedstring value + currentstring
    iterator = iterator + 1;

PRINT combinedstring

END
